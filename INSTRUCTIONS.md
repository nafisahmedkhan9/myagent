# ðŸ¤– AI Agent Setup Instructions

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Resume Content Already Loaded!**

âœ… Your actual resume content has been loaded into the AI agent from `MyResumeLatestV11.txt`

The AI agent now knows about:
- Your work experience at Gupshup Technologies, Artdex, and Cognoscis
- Your skills in AI, chatbots, full-stack development
- Your impressive project portfolio including Smart Receipt Processor
- Your enterprise clients like National Consumer Helpline, Kotak, Swiggy, etc.

### 2. **Get Your Free Groq API Key**

1. Visit: https://console.groq.com/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `gsk_...`)

### 3. **Configure the Agent**

Create/update the `.env` file:
```bash
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
```

### 4. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. **Start the AI Agent**

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### 6. **Test Your Agent**

Visit: http://localhost:8000

Try asking:
- "What are Nafis's technical skills?"
- "Tell me about his work experience at Gupshup?"
- "What's the Smart Receipt Processor project?"
- "Which major clients has he worked with?"
- "What's his educational background?"

## Resume Updates

### Method 1: Edit Text File (Recommended)
1. Update `MyResumeLatestV11.txt` with new content
2. Update the `RESUME_CONTENT` in `config.py` 
3. Restart the AI agent

### Method 2: Update via API
If the agent is running, you can update the resume via API:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/update-resume" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"resume_content": "YOUR_UPDATED_RESUME_CONTENT"}'
```

### Method 3: Direct File Edit
Edit `config.py` and replace the `RESUME_CONTENT` variable with your updated resume.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Command 'python' not found"**
   - Use `python3` instead of `python`

2. **"GROQ_API_KEY not found"**
   - Make sure `.env` file exists with your API key
   - Restart the application after updating .env

3. **"Could not connect to AI agent"**
   - Make sure the agent is running: `python3 main.py`
   - Check if port 8000 is available

4. **Website scraping failed**
   - Your website uses JavaScript, so copy content manually
   - Use browser developer tools to extract text

5. **Empty responses from AI**
   - Check if your API key is valid
   - Ensure resume content is properly loaded

### Getting Help:

1. Check the logs when running `python3 main.py`
2. Visit `/health` endpoint to check API status
3. Use the `/api` endpoint to see available endpoints
